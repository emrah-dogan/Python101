# Python101

This is a repository for my programs that I built as exercises while learning Python. 

1 - hello_world.py -> This is just a "Hello World!" code to test Github.

2 - like_percentage.py -> This is a simple program that calculates the percentage of a social media post. (mainly inspired from a YouTube tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GzrTBLwCgk)

3 - snake.py -> This is a simple snake game coded with PyGame library (mainly inspired from a YouTube tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KjEgCLQFw)
